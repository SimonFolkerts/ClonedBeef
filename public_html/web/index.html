                            <p>Now that we have a world in which objects can be created and time passes, it is time to begin adding functionality to the game itself. The first logical step is to enable
                                the user to move the avatar.<br><br>For this game the game piece should follow the mouse cursor or, if
                                on a touch screen, the users finger press. This can be achieved by modifying the piece's current position
                                by a certain amount on based on the position of the cursor each frame. The simplest way to implement this is by taking the cursor position
                                each frame and setting the piece's position to match that. For that to happen the game piece needs a method that changes the piece's position
                                data each frame.<br><br>newPos() has been added to the component constructor. This method takes an x and a y coordinate and updates the 
                                components position values. The coordinates are retrieved using an event listener. New code has been added to the start method 
                                of the game area. On start, an event listener that fires on mouse move retrieves the coordinates and stores them in the properties
                                of the game area.<br><br>The player can now reach into the world and have their presence felt.</p>

                            <p>Whilst in the previous example the game piece is essentially teleported to the cursor each frame, giving the player unlimited freedom, some restriction is required to
                                achieve a structured and meaningful existence. To achieve this, several new lines of code have been
                                added, including a new function called clamp(). This function clamp() takes three numbers. The second and third numbers passed are used to clamp
                                the first number passed, that is to say that the first number cannot go below the second, nor above the third. This function constrains a number to an upper and
                                lower limit.
                                <br><br>In order to get the game piece moving smoothly and with easing, the newPos() method was modified.
                                The fundamental principle behind the movement is: y += (targetY - y) / speed; This statement increments the y value of the game piece
                                by the difference between the target and the piece's current position, which is then adjusted by the speed parameter. The further away the 
                                piece is from the cursor, the larger the increment and therefore the faster the piece appears to move. The clamp() function is applied to the difference to cap the top speed of the 
                                game piece so that it moves more controllably. This allows acceleration and top speed to be modified separately. The speed and acceleration are passed to the 
                                component when it is called by startGame().</p>

                            <p>The game world is meaningless without a motivating factor. The presence of an adversary will provide that motivation.<br><br>
                                The component constructor has been split onto two separate constructors. One creates the player avatar, the other creates a new component called enemyBasic
                                with a different set of properties. These properties mean the enemyBasic travels automatically in a straight line towards the left, then sets itself to inactive.
                                A new piece of code has a chance to create an enemyBasic at a random point on the right edge of the world. 
                                An accompanying block of code checks the enenmyBasic to see if it is active before updating and redrawing it. 
                                Because the code that creates an enemyBasic overwrites the existing enemyBasic, only one can exist at any given time. The game world has no way of keeping track of more than one
                                instance name enemyPiece.

                                An array in myGameArea must be created, and the code that creates new enemyBasics must append these new entities to this list. In such a way, multiple unique enemyBasics are able to exist side by side.
                                <br><br>However, there is a problem. Each new enemyBasic leads to a new entry in the list, which will keep growing forever. An additional piece of code must also be created that checks for inactive enemyBasics
                                and removes them. The filter method will achieve this goal.

                                Another function collisionHandler() then decides what to do with that information. In this case, if an enemyBasic touches the player avatar, the game stops.
                                This is achieved by using a function that clears the interval that dictates the rate of the passage of time.
